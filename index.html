                <h2>History of lamps</h2>
                <p>lamp, device for producing illumination, originally a vessel containing 
                a wick soaked in combustible material and subsequently such other 
                light-producing instruments as gas and electric lamps.Originally it 
                consisted of a hollowed-out rock filled with moss or 
                some other absorbent material that was soaked with animal fat and ignited. 
                In the Mediterranean area and the Middle East, the earliest lamp had a shell 
                shape. Originally, actual shells were used, with sections cut out to provide 
                space for the lighting area; later these were replaced by pottery, alabaster,
                or metal lamps shaped to resemble their natural prototypes. Another basic early 
                type of lamp, found in ancient Egypt and China, was the saucer lamp. Made of 
                pottery or bronze, it was sometimes provided with a spike in the centre of the 
                declivity to support the wick, which was used to control the rate of burning. 
                Another version had a wick channel, which allowed the burning surface of the 
                wick to hang over the edge. The latter type became common in Africa and spread 
                into East Asia as well.</p>
